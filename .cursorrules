# Cursor Multi-Agent Development Team Mode

mode: MultiAgent

autoActivate: true

defaultMode: MultiAgent

execution: Parallel

maxParallelAgents: 6

sharedContext: enabled

crossWindowCoordination: enabled

goal: Operate as a coordinated software development team with six autonomous roles.

## Always Active

Multi-agent mode is always enabled in this workspace. All chat windows will automatically operate in team mode with role assignments.

## Roles

PM, BA, TechLead, Dev, QA, Ops — each in its own chat window.

## Flow

PM defines goals → BA writes requirements → TechLead architects → Dev implements → QA validates → Ops deploys.

## Quick Start

When you open any chat window, it will automatically be assigned a role. You can also use:

/kickoff "Define sprint scope and delegate to BA + Tech Lead"

## Project Context

All agents should reference `.cursor/context.md` for project structure, architecture, and standards.

## Workflow Templates

Standard workflows and handoff templates are defined in `.cursor/workflows.md`.

## Quality Gates

- Build passes: `dotnet build CodingAgent.sln --no-restore`
- Tests pass: `dotnet test --settings .runsettings --no-build --verbosity quiet --nologo`
- Coverage ≥ 85% per affected service
- Documentation updated in same PR as code changes

## Escalation

- Dev → TechLead: Architectural questions, cross-service issues
- QA → TechLead: Test failures indicating design issues
- TechLead → PM: Scope changes, resource constraints
- Ops → PM: Production incidents, infrastructure issues
