## What Went Well

### 1. Architecture-First Approach

Creating comprehensive architecture documentation (ADRs, service catalog) before implementation:
- Reduced ambiguity
- Faster onboarding
- Clear acceptance criteria

**Impact**: Enabled parallel development with minimal coordination

### 2. Incremental Delivery

Phased approach with working deliverables at each stage:
- Phase 0: Architecture validated
- Phase 1: Gateway + Auth operational
- Phase 2: Core services functional
- Each phase built on previous

**Impact**: Maintained momentum and early validation

### 3. Test-First Development

High test coverage from early phases:
- Integration tests with Testcontainers
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Unit tests for all services

**Impact**: High confidence in deployments

### 4. Observability Early

Setting up Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger from Phase 1:
- Enabled debugging and performance tuning
- Proactive issue detection
- Performance insights

**Impact**: Faster troubleshooting and optimization

### 5. Shared Kernel

Early identification and extraction of common code:
- Eliminated duplication
- Consistent patterns across services
- Faster development

**Impact**: Eliminated 112+ lines of duplicate code

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: FluentValidation with Minimal APIs

**Issue**: Validation errors returning 500 instead of 400

**Solution**: Manual error dictionary conversion instead of `ToDictionary()` extension

**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Challenge 2: JWT Configuration Consistency

**Issue**: Different services expected different config paths

**Solution**: Support both `Jwt:*` and `Authentication:Jwt:*` paths

**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Challenge 3: Testcontainers in CI

**Issue**: Docker not always available in CI environments

**Solution**: Graceful degradation - skip tests if Docker unavailable

**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Challenge 4: Chat Validation Tests

**Issue**: 43 tests failing with 500 instead of 400

**Solution**: Fixed validation error handling in ConversationEndpoints

**Status**: ✅ Resolved (current iteration)
