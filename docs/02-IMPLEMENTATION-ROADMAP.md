## Risk Management

### High Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status (Oct 25, 2025) |
|------|------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **Underestimated Complexity** | Medium | High | Add 20% buffer to each phase | ✅ **Mitigated** - Phase 1 completed ahead of schedule |
| **Integration Issues** | High | Medium | POC in Phase 0 validates approach | ✅ **Resolved** - All services wired with MassTransit, tests passing |
| **Data Migration Errors** | Medium | Critical | Dual-write period + rollback plan | ⏳ **Pending** - Phase 5 concern, migrations validated in Phase 1 |
| **Performance Degradation** | Low | High | Load testing in Phase 4 | ⏳ **Pending** - Observability foundation ready |
| **Scope Creep** | High | Medium | Strict scope definition, Phase 7 for extras | ✅ **Under Control** - Focused on core services |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Weekly Progress Reviews**: Adjust timeline if falling behind
   - ✅ **Status**: Phase 1 delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule (4 weeks vs. planned 6 weeks)
2. **Automated Testing**: 85%+ coverage prevents regressions
   - ✅ **Status**: 46/46 tests passing, Testcontainers configured, 100% test pass rate maintained
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout and rollback
   - ⏳ **Status**: Planned for Phase 4 deployment
4. **Rollback Plan**: Keep old system operational until cutover validated
   - ⏳ **Status**: Planned for Phase 5 migration

**Lessons Learned (Phase 1):**
- SharedKernel infrastructure extensions prevent code duplication across services (eliminated 112 lines of duplicate code in Week 4)
- Testcontainers with Docker fallback ensures tests pass in all environments (CI/CD + local dev)
- AI-assisted development (GitHub Copilot) accelerates delivery without sacrificing code quality
